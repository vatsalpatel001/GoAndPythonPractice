## How to Use

1. Navigate to the language and difficulty level you want to practice
2. Each file contains:
   - A problem description in comments
   - Function signature(s) with placeholder implementation
   - Test cases to verify your solution
3. Implement your solution in the placeholder areas
4. Run the file to test your implementation

## Tips for Interview Preparation

- Start with easier problems and progress to harder ones
- Practice explaining your thought process as you solve problems
- Pay attention to:
  - Time and space complexity
  - Edge cases
  - Code readability and maintainability
- Review and optimize your solutions

Happy coding!
